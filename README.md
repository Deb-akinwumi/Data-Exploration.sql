Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Super Store Dataset from Kaggle

Global Mart is an online supergiant store that has worldwide operations. The store takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories â€” Furniture, Office Supplies and Technology. I explore insights on: 

-Which is most the consistently profitable market-segment?

-Which country has the most sales?

-What is the average delivery time across the counties?

-Which sub-categories were most profitable?


Created interactive Tableau Dashboard to visualize the data.
